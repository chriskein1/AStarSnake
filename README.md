My fully object-oriented implementation of the classic game Snake in C++, with an Artificial Intelligence spin!
Uses the classic A* pathfinding algorithm.
Made using SFML.

# Features

Normal / AI play
Normal bounds includes collision detection as intended.
AI play is a strict implementation of A*. Bounds checking WIP.
AI play includes a debug console, which shows the searched cells as well as the path chosen.

# Keybinds
1 - normal speed <br />
2 - 2x speed <br />
3 - 4x speed <br />
4 - 6x speed <br />
5 - Max speed <br />
